# README

## What is this?

This is the main repository for my website, [dansoloha.me](https://dansoloha.me). This is where I do the majority of my testing and expirementing before pushing any code live.

## Can I contribute?

Absolutely! I'm open to any and all suggestions, and if you have any code you'd like to submit, simply create a new pull request with your changes.

## I've found a bug!

You can open a new issue and I'll try to fix it, or, if you want to fix it yourself, you can do that, then open a new pull request.
